# Kidnapped Vehicle Project 
By Pablo Sauras Perez

## Submission code location
The submited code can be found in the **src** directory. In particular, the following files have been modified:
- particle_filter.cpp

## Important Depencencies
As stated in the project description, these are the important dependencies.
- cmake >= 3.5
- make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
- gcc/g++ >= 5.4

## Basic Build Instructions
Follow this instructions to compile and run the code (from original project description):

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh


## Results
Execute the program to see the results.

At the time of submission, this code has been executed in a Linux machine. The execution "Ran out of time". However, as discussed in the forum, this issue may be solved by executing the program in a more powerful machine.
